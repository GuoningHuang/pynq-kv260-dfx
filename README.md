# pynq-kv260-dfx
A demo using kv260 and pynq to implement simple dfx
## add_sub_dfx
This demo implments A DFX between add and sub. The initial function of the top.bit is add.After dfx,the function changes to sub.\
## mul_dot_dfx
This demo implements a DFX between matrix multiplication and element-wise (dot) multiplication. Initially, the demo performs matrix multiplication. After DFX, the functionality changes to element-wise (dot) multiplication.\
### bitstreams
The initial top.bit performs matrix multiplication. \
hier_0_0_1.bit performs element-wise (dot) multiplication.\
hier_0.bit performs matrix multiplication.\
### interface
The IP core generated by HLS includes the following interfaces:
- **S-AXI Lite Interface**:  This interface is followed by a `decouple` module.
- **M-AXI Interface**: This interface is followed by an `AXI shutdown` module.
